However, TechCrunch has been told that Clark County regulators have approved just 11 human-driven vehicles so far, set strict speed limits and forbidden the use of on-board collision-avoidance technology that is part of Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;full self-driving&#8221; Autopilot advanced driver assistance system. Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot system technically does not rise to the level of fully autonomous, even though it is branded as such. It is considered \u2014 even internally, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/07\/tesla-refutes-elon-musks-timeline-on-full-self-driving\/\">according to exchanges between Tesla and California regulators<\/a> \u2014 an advanced driver assistance system that can automate certain functions.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>LVCC\u2019s parent body, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitor\u2019s Authority, created a contract aimed at incentivizing Musk and ensuring promises are met. The contract is for a fixed price, and TBC has to hit specific milestones to receive all of its payments. The contract provides payments at different points in the process, such as completing the bare tunnels, the entire working system, finishing a <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">test period and safety report and then demonstrating it can carry passengers. The final three milestones relate to how many passengers it can carry. If the Loop can demonstrate moving 2,200 passengers an hour, TBC will get $4.4 million, then the same payment again for hitting 3,300, and the same again for 4,400 passengers an hour. Together, these capacity payments represent 30% of the fixed-price contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Instead of moving more than 4,000 passengers an hour, the constrained system could limit the capacity to less than 1,000, exposing TBC to hefty penalties for missing contractual targets. TBC doesn&#8217;t generate revenue from charging passengers (the rides are free).<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Update<\/strong><\/em>: Shortly after publication, Steve Hill, president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SHillforVegas\/status\/1398497136623247361?s=20\">tweeted that a Loop<\/a> test this week, with a few hundred participants, had demonstrated its planned 4,400 passenger per hour capacity. This could release the additional construction funds mentioned below. TBC still has to achieve this figure during actual conferences in the months ahead to avoid penalties. TechCrunch shared its reporting with the LVCVA, Clark Country and TBC numerous times, over a period of weeks, prior to publication. Only LVCVA provided a substantive reply, and none addressed the question of capacity, nor the outstanding questions about children or passengers with mobility issues.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, during a large trade show like CES, the LVCC will pay TBC $30,000 for every day it operates and manages the system, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/20702362-2021-1-management-agreement-feb-4-final\">management agreement<\/a> newly obtained by TechCrunch. However, the original contract signed by TBC in 2019 specifies a $300,000 penalty for each large convention where TBC cannot move around 4,000 people per hour.<\/p>\n<p>This means that over the course of a three- or four-day event, TBC stands to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars, above and beyond the cost of running the system. In a typical pre-pandemic year, LVCC would host around a dozen such large shows. It&#8217;s unclear if TBC is planning on another means of making money such as revenue from advertising in its cars.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Nf5h7wegCw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/16\/elon-musk-boring-company-the-brick-store\/\">The Boring Company goes brick-and-mortar with The Brick Store<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The Boring Company goes brick-and-mortar with The Brick Store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/16\/elon-musk-boring-company-the-brick-store\/embed\/#?secret=Nf5h7wegCw\" data-secret=\"Nf5h7wegCw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>This capacity issue is already costing TBC money. The contract states that if TBC misses its performance target by such a margin, Musk\u2019s company will not receive more than $13 million of its construction budget. The convention center authority confirmed to TechCrunch that, per its contract, it is withholding that construction fee until TBC can demonstrate moving thousands of people an hour.<\/p>\n<p>Smaller shows, numbering about 20 a year, carry no capacity penalties but earn TBC a much smaller fee of just $11,500 a day, according to the agreement. TBC also receives a monthly payment of $167,000 to keep the system ticking over, regardless of how many conventions are running.<\/p>\n<p>A capacity test of the Loop this week <a href=\"https:\/\/news3lv.com\/news\/local\/las-vegas-convention-center-prepares-for-return-of-business\">reportedly involved just 300 people<\/a>; a Convention Center official did say the 4,400 people-per-hour figure was &#8220;well within our sights.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As well as its team of human drivers, TBC has to staff an operations center and a maintenance and charging facility, and provide uniformed customer service personnel, security staff and a full-time resident manager, according to the management agreement.<\/p>\n<p>The fee structure is set to be renegotiated &#8212; presumably downwards &#8212; by the end of 2021, to incorporate the &#8220;expected transition to autonomous vehicle operations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2158847\" style=\"width: 4224px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1311709444.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2158847\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2158847 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1311709444.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4214\" height=\"2859\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1311709444.jpg 4214w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1311709444.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1311709444.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1311709444.jpg?resize=768,521 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1311709444.jpg?resize=680,461 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1311709444.jpg?resize=1536,1042 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1311709444.jpg?resize=2048,1389 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1311709444.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4214px) 100vw, 4214px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2158847\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Ethan Miller \/ Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Collision warnings out<\/h2>\n<p>Some of the restrictions on the Loop&#8217;s initial operation came from the Clark County Department of Building and Fire Prevention. These reportedly include a 40 mph overall speed limit, dropping to 10 mph within each of the Loop&#8217;s three stations, and a restriction to just 11 vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>Deputy Fire Chief Warren Whitney of the Clark County Fire Department said that TBC had told him the company wasn&#8217;t allowed to use Tesla&#8217;s collision warning systems within the Loop. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/20792266-2021-5-11-ats-certificate\">transportation system certificate<\/a> issued by Clark County this week specified that the Loop must use &#8220;non-autonomous&#8221; &#8220;manually driven&#8221; vehicles. It was issued for the planned 62 vehicles. Neither Clark County officials nor TBC provided responses to detailed questions on the operational restrictions, nor indicated when or if they could be lifted.<\/p>\n<p>Toyota has previously warned that its radar-based collision warning system may not function correctly within tunnels.<\/p>\n<p>It is not clear whether the Teslas are capable of safe and &#8220;fully autonomous operation&#8221; without their collision-warning radars, although Musk has suggested &#8212; and now executed on a plan &#8212; to remove radar sensors from its vehicles and only use cameras. Tesla started delivering Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in May that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/25\/tesla-is-no-longer-using-radar-sensors-in-model-3-and-model-y-vehicles-built-in-north-america\/\">do not have radar sensors<\/a>. The lack of radar sensors has prompted the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration to say that Model 3 and Model Y vehicles built on or after April 27, 2021 will no longer receive the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/27\/tesla-has-activated-its-in-car-camera-to-monitor-drivers-using-autopilot\/\">agency&#8217;s check mark<\/a> for automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, lane departure warning and dynamic brake support. The decision also prompted Consumer Reports to no longer list the Model 3 as a Top Pick, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said it plans to remove the Model 3&#8217;s Top Safety Pick+ designation.<\/p>\n<p>The Fire Department also had concerns about dealing with emergencies within the tunnels, including battery fires that can potentially last many hours. &#8220;There have been cases where electric cars have caught fire without an accident,&#8221; Whitney told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our plan right now would be just to get the people out, then pull back and let the fire continue to burn.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Whitney noted the system has many cameras and smoke alarms, as well as a &#8220;robust&#8221; ventilation system that can move 400,000 cubic feet of air per minute in either direction down the tunnels. This should allow passengers and drivers to escape on foot around the cars. For less serious incidents, TBC has a tow vehicle (also a Tesla) to extract broken-down cars.<\/p>\n<p>Neither TBC nor Clark County replied to TechCrunch queries about whether the Loop would be allowed to transport wheelchair users, children or infants usually requiring car seats, people with other mobility issues or pets and support animals.<\/p>\n<p>Firefighters have already conducted multiple drills in the underground system, including simulated accidents far from a station, with two or three other vehicles in the way. &#8220;Eleven cars is definitely doable,&#8221; says Whitney. &#8220;But when you start increasing numbers of cars, it may be a problem. [TBC] is a for-profit company and is going want to maximize the efficiency, so there may be further discussions as they try to increase the capacity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Expansion plans<\/h2>\n<p>Not only does TBC want to use more vehicles in the existing Loop, it is already planning to expand the system. At the end of March, TBC told Clark County that it had broken ground on an extension from one LVCC station to the new Resorts World hotel, and it is has permission for a similar spur to the Encore nearby.<\/p>\n<p>More significantly, TBC also wants to build a transit system covering much of the Strip and downtown Las Vegas with more than 40 stations connecting dozens of hotels, attractions and, ultimately, the airport. That system would be financed by TBC and supported by ticket sales.<\/p>\n<p>The viability of those expansions could depend on how soon TBC can meet the technological and operational promises it made for its relatively simple LVCC Loop, and demonstrate whether taxis in tunnels can generate as much revenue as they do column inches.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"rRoZvBv8gr\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/16\/elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-might-only-carry-a-fraction-of-the-passengers-it-promised\/\">Elon Musk&#8217;s Las Vegas Loop might only carry a fraction of the passengers it promised<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Elon Musk&#8217;s Las Vegas Loop might only carry a fraction of the passengers it promised&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/16\/elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-might-only-carry-a-fraction-of-the-passengers-it-promised\/embed\/#?secret=rRoZvBv8gr\" data-secret=\"rRoZvBv8gr\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Please see update below&#8230; Restrictions put in place by Nevada regulators are making it difficult for The Boring Company (TBC) to meet contractual targets for its LVCC Loop, Elon Musk&#8217;s first underground transportation system.

in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Las Vegas Convention Center Loop is an underground transportation system that is the first commercial project by Elon Musk\u2019s The Boring Company. The USD 52.5 million loop, which includes two one-way vehicle tunnels 40 feet beneath the ground and three passenger stations, will take convention attendees across the 200-acre convention campus for free in all-electric Tesla vehicles in under two minutes. To walk that distance can take upward of 25 minutes. The system is designed to carry 4,400 people per hour using a fleet of 62 vehicles at maximum capacity. It is scheduled to be fully operational in June when the facility plans to host its first large-scale convention since the COVID-19 shutdown. There are plans to expand the system throughout the resort corridor in the future.

pandemic. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/05\/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux\/\">The changes wrought by<\/a> a global shift to remote work and schooling are myriad, but in the business realm they have yielded a change in corporate behavior and consumer expectation &#8212; changes that showed up in a bushel of earnings reports this week.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch may tend to have a private-company focus, but we do keep tabs on public companies in the tech world as they often provide hints, notes and other pointers on how startups may be faring. In this case, however, we\u2019re working in reverse; startups have told us for several quarters now that their markets are picking up momentum as customers shake up their buying behavior with a distinct advantage for companies helping customers move into the digital realm. And public company results are now confirming the startups\u2019 perspective.<\/p>\n<p>The accelerating digital transformation is real, and we have the data to support the point.<\/p>\n<p>What follows is a digest of notes concerning the recent earnings results from Box, Sprout Social, Yext, Snowflake and Salesforce. We\u2019ll approach each in micro to save time, but as always there\u2019s more digging to be done if you have time.

Today its shares are up 18%. And a call with the company\u2019s CEO Howard Lerman underscored our general thesis regarding the digital transformation\u2019s acceleration.<\/p>\n<p>In brief, Yext\u2019s evolution from a company that plugged corporate information into external search engines to building and selling search tech itself has been resonating in the market. Why? Lerman explained that consumers more and more expect digital service in response to their questions &#8212; &#8220;who wants to call a 1-800 number,&#8221; he asked rhetorically &#8212; which is forcing companies to rethink the way they handle customer inquiries.<\/p>\n<p>In turn, those companies are looking to companies like Yext that offer technology to better answer customer queries in a digital format. It\u2019s customer-friendly, and could save companies money as call centers are expensive. A change in behavior accelerated by the pandemic is forcing companies to adapt, driving their purchase of more digital technologies like this.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s proof that a transformation doesn&#8217;t have to be dramatic to have pretty strong impacts on how corporations buy and sell online.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What follows is a digest of notes concerning the recent earnings results from Box, Sprout Social, Yext, Snowflake and Salesforce.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":521068,"featured_media":2158949,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"d3e40516-6bc0-3af2-a52a-10d65bfbaf4d"},"categories":[24405894,42919851,449557044,576605952],"tags":[53395,576846311,15328,97017,924097,36036697,25753030],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796354],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1271697775.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3vvF8Ek","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.37,"featured":true,"subtitle":"And impacting the latest SaaS earnings reports","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1461024,983141],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2158933"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2158933"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2158933\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2159065,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2158933\/revisions\/2159065"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/alex-wilhelm"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/ronjourn"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2158933&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/521068"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2158949"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2158933"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2158933"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2158933"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2158933"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2158933"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2158933"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2158933"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1461024,"name":"Alex Wilhelm","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/alex-wilhelm\/","description":"Alex Wilhelm is the editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchbase.news\">Crunchbase News<\/a> and co-host of <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/equity\/id1215439780?mt=2\">Equity<\/a>, TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast.","slug":"alex-wilhelm","links":{"facebook":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alex.wilhelm","twitter":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alexwilhelm\/","homepage":"","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/alex-wilhelm"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"<p>Alex Wilhelm is Senior Editor at TechCrunch.

is the new AI research outfit from OpenAI&#8217;s Dario Amodei, and it has $124M to burn"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">As AI has grown from a menagerie of research projects to include a handful of titanic, industry-powering models like GPT-3, there is a need for the sector to evolve \u2014 or so thinks Dario Amodei, former VP of research at OpenAI, who struck out on his own to create a new company a few months ago. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropic.com\/\">Anthropic<\/a>, as it&#8217;s called, was founded with his sister Daniela and its goal is to create &#8220;large-scale AI systems that are steerable, interpretable, and robust.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The challenge the siblings Amodei are tackling is simply that these AI models, while incredibly powerful, are not well understood. GPT-3, which they worked on, is an astonishingly versatile language system that can produce extremely convincing text in practically any style, and on any topic.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hDo1z2rXH9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/17\/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable\/\">Okay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Okay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/17\/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable\/embed\/#?secret=hDo1z2rXH9\" data-secret=\"hDo1z2rXH9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>But say you had it generate rhyming couplets with Shakespeare and Pope as examples. How does it do it? What is it &#8220;thinking&#8221;? Which knob would you tweak, which dial would you turn, to make it more melancholy, less romantic, or limit its diction and lexicon in specific ways? Certainly there are parameters to change here and there, but really no one knows exactly how this extremely convincing language sausage is being made.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one thing to not know when an AI model is generating poetry, quite another when the model is watching a department store for suspicious behavior, or fetching legal precedents for a judge about to pass down a sentence. Today the general rule is: the more powerful the system, the harder it is to explain its actions. That&#8217;s not exactly a good trend.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Large, general systems of today can have significant benefits, but can also be unpredictable, unreliable, and opaque: our goal is to make progress on these issues,&#8221; reads the company&#8217;s self-description. &#8220;For now, we\u2019re primarily focused on research towards these goals; down the road, we foresee many opportunities for our work to create value commercially and for public benefit.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Excited to announce what we\u2019ve been working on this year &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnthropicAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AnthropicAI<\/a>, an AI safety and research company. If you\u2019d like to help us combine safety research with scaling ML models while thinking about societal impacts, check out our careers page <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/TVHA0t7VLc\">https:\/\/t.co\/TVHA0t7VLc<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Daniela Amodei (@DanielaAmodei) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DanielaAmodei\/status\/1398306463945158656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>The goal seems to be to integrate safety principles into the existing priority system of AI development that generally favors efficiency and power. Like any other industry, it&#8217;s easier and more effective to incorporate something from the beginning than to bolt it on at the end. Attempting to make some of the biggest models out there able to be picked apart and understood may be more work than building them in the first place. Anthropic seems to be starting fresh.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Anthropic\u2019s goal is to make the fundamental research advances that will let us build more capable, general, and reliable AI systems, then deploy these systems in a way that benefits people,&#8221; said Dario Amodei, CEO of the new venture, in a short post announcing the company and its $124 million in funding.<\/p>\n<p>That funding, by the way, is as star-studded as you might expect. It was led by Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and included James McClave, Dustin Moskovitz, Eric Schmidt and the Center for Emerging Risk Research, among others.<\/p>\n<p>The company is a public benefit corporation, and the plan for now, as the limited information on the site suggests, is to remain heads-down on researching these fundamental questions of how to make large models more tractable and interpretable. We can expect more information later this year, perhaps, as the mission and team coalesces and initial results pan out.<\/p>\n<p>The name, incidentally, is adjacent to anthropocentric, and concerns relevancy to human experience or existence. Perhaps it derives from the &#8220;Anthropic principle,&#8221; the notion that intelligent life is possible in the universe because&#8230; well, we&#8217;re here.

TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>India\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/25\/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets\/\">new IT rules<\/a>, unveiled in February this year, require firms to appoint and share contact details of representatives tasked with\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">compliance, nodal point of reference and grievance redressals to address on-ground concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The aforementioned firms have complied with this requirement, the government note and a person familiar with the matter said. The firms were required to comply with the new IT rules by this week.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Twitter has yet to comply with the rules. \u201cTwitter sent a communication late last night, sharing details of a lawyer working in a law firm in India as their Nodal Contact Person and Grievance Officer,\u201d a note prepared by New Delhi said, adding that the rules require the aforementioned officials to be direct employees.<\/p>\n<p>Tension has been brewing between Twitter and the government of India of late. This week, police in Delhi <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/24\/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label\/\">visited Twitter offices to \u201cserve a notice\u201d about an investigation<\/a> into its intel on classifying Indian politicians\u2019 tweets as misleading. Twitter called the move <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/27\/twitter-says-concerned-with-india-intimidation-requests-3-more-months-to-comply-with-new-it-rules\/\">a form of intimidation<\/a>, cited concerns about its employees and requested the government to respect citizens&#8217; rights to free speech.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"99gNi9AaUM\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/20\/google-facebook-and-twitter-threaten-to-leave-pakistan-over-censorship-law\/\">Google, Facebook and Twitter threaten to leave Pakistan over censorship law<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google, Facebook and Twitter threaten to leave Pakistan over censorship law&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/20\/google-facebook-and-twitter-threaten-to-leave-pakistan-over-censorship-law\/embed\/#?secret=99gNi9AaUM\" data-secret=\"99gNi9AaUM\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>WhatsApp has complied with the aforementioned rules, but not with the requirement about traceability, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. WhatsApp <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/25\/whatsapp-sues-india-government\/\">sued the Indian government earlier this week<\/a> over the requirement about bringing a way to trace the originator of messages. WhatsApp said it would have to compromise every users&#8217; privacy to be able to comply with this rule.<\/p>\n<p>It is unclear at this point whether Apple, which operates iMessage, and Signal have complied with the rules.<\/p>\n<p>India&#8217;s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on Wednesday had <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/india-says-whatsapps-lawsuit-over-new-regulations-a-clear-act-of-defiance\/\">asked the social media firms for an update on their compliant status<\/a>, TechCrunch first reported.<\/p>\n<p>India is a key overseas market for several technology giants, including Facebook and Google, both of which identify the nation as its biggest market by users. Neighboring nation Pakistan, which had proposed similar rules as India last year, had to withdraw them after tech giants united and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/20\/google-facebook-and-twitter-threaten-to-leave-pakistan-over-censorship-law\/\">threatened to leave the nation<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google, Facebook, Telegram, LinkedIn and Tiger Global-backed Indian startups ShareChat and Koo have either fully or partially complied with the South Asian nation\u2019s new IT rules, according to two people familiar with the matter and a government note obtained by TechCrunch.

you want to democratize venture capital"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A venture capitalist once told me candidly that whenever you see the phrase &#8220;democratization&#8221; in tech marketing material, think of it as a red flag. Democracy, generally speaking, often comes with an ironic caveat: It disproportionately benefits white and male participants. Now, you know me well enough to know that I wouldn\u2019t start off your Saturday with this dreary of an introduction normally, but I think that that reality is why a new tool, championed by tech entrepreneurs Lolita and Josh Taub, could be on to something actually innovative.<\/p>\n<p>The Taubs have launched a GP-LP, or general partner and limited partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notion.so\/lolitataub\/GP-LP-Matching-Tool-a294b1d887ed46d7892f66f826a5631f\">matching tool<\/a> to help underrepresented fund managers get access to the capital they need to start their fund. The match-making tool connects those looking to raise funds (GPs!) with check-writers (LPs!). The move comes on the heels of their founder-investor matching tool, which to date has generated over 1,000 introductions that they say have led to 27 checks totaling nearly $4 million in total capital.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, matching LPs to GPs is a relatively simple tech and concept. And this is a relatively simple experiment. But, it couldn\u2019t have existed five, and definitely 10, years ago. Zoom investing has changed the way that people meet and vet, and I think the GP-LP tool is a key data point in how emerging fund managers can bring optionality to their fundraising process.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><em>Speaking of fundraising:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/27\/dismantling-the-myths-around-raising-your-first-check\/\">Dismantling the myths around raising your first check\u00a0<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/vise-ceo-samir-vasavada-and-sequoias-shaun-maguire-break-down-the-art-of-the-pitch\/\">Vise CEO Samir Vasavada and Sequoia\u2019s Shaun Maguire break down the art of the pitch\u00a0<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/24\/when-to-walk-away-from-a-vc-who-wants-to-invest-in-your-startup\">When to walk away from a VC who wants to invest in your startup<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The tool\u2019s explicit focus on only helping underrepresented folks &#8212; which it defines as anyone who doesn\u2019t fit the classic Silicon Valley mold like women, LGBTQ+ folks, non-Ivy grads (or people from non-elite employers) and non-wealthy individuals &#8212; is a layer of differentiation from many other tools out there. Products like the AngelList rolling fund are great, but public, ongoing fundraising still largely benefits those who have networks to tap into in the first place \u2014 just take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.angellist.com\/rolling\">a quick scroll<\/a> to see who has one so far.<\/p>\n<p>Let me put it like this: We\u2019ve gotten to a point in venture where there are an ample number of tools out there that help founders and investors leverage their community into checks. What\u2019s missing, though, are the tools that help the community-less, undernetworked and underestimated access those opportunities. While there still is LP hesitancy as emerging managers raise their second and third funds, this effort is a good step in the right direction. And I\u2019ll be tracking it to see how successfully it works.<\/p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s been a big week for Black and other underrepresented founders:\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>This <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/27\/this-250-million-growth-fund-will-divert-half-its-profits-to-historically-black-colleges-and-universities\/\">$250M growth fund will divert half its profits<\/a> to historically Black colleges and universities<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/collab-capital-closes-50-million-debut-fund-for-black-founders\/\">Collab Capital closes $50 million debut fund to back Black founders<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Moving on, the rest of this newsletter will focus on disaster tech, Airbnb and a healthcare communications S-1 filing.

In celebration for this week\u2019s Exchange letter we\u2019ll try something new by being brief.\u00a0<\/em><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>If you are tired of hearing about cryptocurrencies, I have bad news. They are not only not going away, but it appears that the financial cannon that have helped clear the fields for their general advance are reloading with even more financial ammunition.<\/p>\n<p>At least that\u2019s what Eric Newcomer is reporting in a post out this week aptly titled \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.newcomer.co\/p\/a16z-crypto-fund-balloons-to-2-billion\">a16z Crypto Fund Balloons to $2 Billion<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This raises a few points. First! That there is enough LP demand to fund a crypto vehicle to the tune of $2 billion. Second! That there are enough hot crypto ideas out there worth sticking $2 billion into.<\/p>\n<p>I can entirely believe the former, but the latter stretches my brain a little. Not that there aren\u2019t great companies being built in the blockchain space; Coinbase\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context\/\">Q1 earnings<\/a> indicate that you can make money with crypto. But it seems that the firms that have proven the most successful thus far are more a hybrid of the traditional banking world and the crypto space than entirely inhabitants of the latter.<\/p>\n<p>But as those ideas have been mined to increasing perfection, we should anticipate seeing money chase the more experimental crypto ideas. As I noted in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/27\/daily-crunch-12\/\">the Daily Crunch yesterday<\/a>, there\u2019s a lot of money already going into those markets:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>[Y]ou\u2019ve heard of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. If you have already digested the NBA TopShot hype wave, buckle in, because a lot of folks are still building in the NFT world. That includes Anima, which is bringing AR to NFTs and just raised new capital from Coinbase, and Infinite Objects, which just raised $6 million to help folks bring their NFTs IRL.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This is where venture investing in crypto &#8212; and that mammoth a16z fund &#8212; gets interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, crypto exchanges can make money. But what about the further reaches of the crypto economy? Can they build material revenues that the fiat world can understand and go public? (Do they even want to go public?)<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a pleasure to watch other people wager other people\u2019s money on ideas that may fail. Heads they lose, tails we win. Not bad!<\/p>\n<h2>Twitter\u2019s subscription (and media?) moment<\/h2>\n<p>Twitter\u2019s \u201cBlue\u201d subscription product is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/28\/twitter-blue-a-3-monthly-subscription-service-could-be-coming-soon\/\">slowly dripping its way into the market<\/a>. I\u2019m going to buy it, whatever it is.<\/p>\n<p>But what I can\u2019t get out of my head is that Twitter is very well positioned to build a sort of creator nirvana. After all, Twitter is already where many writers, journalists and artists hang out. Where we already have a following. Why not help us weirdos leverage all the time we\u2019ve spent on the platform?<\/p>\n<p>You can see how this could scale. Now that Twitter has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/twitter-acquires-revue\/\">bought startups Revue and Scroll<\/a>, it could build a newsletter platform where Blue subscriber money is divvied up amongst writers for its platform. Or Twitter could buy Medium, as a friend suggested to me the other day. Medium has a huge subscriber base, which Twitter could merge into Blue and provide a sort of extra-social-network-network for writers and other creatives.

But as we know, the startup world is evolving, and that means the impact of investment is no longer limited to how much money is made.<\/p>\n<p>As investors, we\u2019re looking further into what each investment <em>means<\/em> to human beings, at interlinking our mission with our money. And yet, one of the events that generates the most momentum for long-term impact &#8212; the successful exit of a portfolio company &#8212; is not being harnessed.<\/p>\n<p>When leveraged properly, an exit can be the beginning of a firm\u2019s true impact, especially when we\u2019re talking about giving all founders equal opportunities and empowering the best ideas. The investment sphere is slowly shaking off its \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach as foreign products take the world by storm and international businesses become the norm.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tWhen leveraged properly, an exit can be the beginning of a firm\u2019s true impact, especially when we\u2019re talking about giving all founders equal opportunities and empowering the best ideas.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Investors will be driving forces in enabling the highest-potential companies to build products that countries everywhere will benefit from &#8212; no matter where they were conceived. The way they play the game can transform the industry into one in which a founder from across the ocean has as much of a chance to change the world as one from next door.<\/p>\n<p>We know the basics of how to do this with cash: Investing in underrepresented founders is a necessary first step. But who\u2019s talking about the power of exits to change the playing field for diverse founders? We must consider the psychological motivation of seeing a huge buyout on other entrepreneurs, what that startup\u2019s ex-team members go on to build, and what the achievements of one citizen does for that nation\u2019s reputation.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, 41 venture-backed companies saw a billion-dollar exit, totaling over $100 billion, the<a href=\"https:\/\/theventure.city\/status-of-vc-q4-2020\/\"> highest numbers<\/a> in a decade. We have an unprecedented amount of clout to do something with those power moves and four ways to turn them into a domino effect.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Competitor effect<\/h2>\n<p>When a foreign entrepreneur raises money from U.S. firms and sells to a U.S. company, other immigrants see that. Regardless of how groundbreaking their product idea might be, immigrant Americans will always be more wary of putting their eggs into the entrepreneurship basket, at least as long as 93% of all VC money continues to be<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/elizabethedwards\/2021\/02\/24\/check-your-stats-the-lack-of-diversity-in-venture-capital-is-worse-than-it-looks\/?sh=6c2586a8185d\"> controlled by white men<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This, despite research suggesting that immigrants contribute<a href=\"https:\/\/behavioralscientist.org\/how-immigrants-drive-entrepreneurship-invention-innovation\/\"> 40% more to innovation<\/a> than local inventors.<\/p>\n<p>What these foreign entrepreneurs most need is confidence, role models and success stories proving other people who look like them have made it, especially when those founders are making waves in the same industry as them.<\/p>\n<p>So a big, well-publicized exit will create momentum in the industry for other foreign founders to give fuel to their venture and seek to take it to the next stage. Not only that, it will instill more self-assurance when it comes to fundraising, and investors will value that.<\/p>\n<p>I was inspired to write this column after Returnly, a fintech founded by a fellow immigrant from Spain based in San Francisco &#8212; which, for full transparency, I invested in as an angel investor, and then for Series B and C via my fund &#8212; was acquired for<a href=\"https:\/\/www.affirm.com\/press\/releases\/affirm-to-acquire-returnly\"> $300 million by Affirm<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While there was undoubtedly a personal financial gain worth celebrating, the success of a foreign founder who persevered against the odds in such a competitive ecosystem as Silicon Valley, raised large rounds from U.S.-based investors, and was finally acquired by a U.S. company served as a moment of inspiration for other diverse founders around the world. We saw this in the amount of media attention it received in both business and mainstream press in Spain and the floods of connect requests and congratulations that followed on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>The impact of an exit is greater when it shows foreign entrepreneurs that there are globally minded organizations helping startups like theirs get equal access to funding. That means having VC firms that spotlight international entrepreneurship and foster global expert networks.<\/p>\n<p>As investors, we can maximize the impact of our exits in the industry by highlighting the foreign origins of our founders in a big way when it comes to promoting the exit, including narrating the challenges and opportunities they encountered on their journey. We can use the victory to drive the point home to our fellow investors that diverse and international entrepreneurship is an undervalued gem. We can personally take the win to boost our brand as one that empowers foreign entrepreneurs in that niche, attracting more to seek funding with us in a positive reinforcement cycle.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Wealth effect<\/h2>\n<p>The windfall from a big exit puts all previous investors in a privileged position, and it\u2019s unlikely that money will sit around for long. They\u2019ll look to reinvest in other high-potential companies &#8212; probably ones that look a lot like the one that was just sold.<\/p>\n<p>But in addition to those investors multiplying the positive impact in their own portfolio, they will rally other investors to behave in a similar way.<\/p>\n<p>Each exit &#8212; good or bad &#8212; sets a precedent for that niche and that type of company. Other investors will follow suit if they sense that one of their peers is onto a cash cow. Because foreign and ethnic minority founders are still underrepresented in startup funding, it makes this field less competitive while harboring huge potential. VCs who have an eye out for unique opportunities will spot when an investor has made a hefty profit from an unconventional startup, especially if they continue to invest in others in that same field.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NTPHL1YhIP\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/17\/want-to-double-your-rate-of-return-seek-counsel-from-experienced-executives\/\">Want to double your rate of return?

They can also be vocal within their network about their decision to raise up certain entrepreneurs because they\u2019ve seen it works.<\/p>\n<p>Returnly\u2019s founder recently offered to put some of his earnings back into our fund, enabling more foreign entrepreneurs like himself to access capital. If as investors we foster meaningful relationships with our funders and truly care about empowering diverse entrepreneurs, we\u2019ll see more of that wealth circle back into our mission.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Team effect<\/h2>\n<p>The PayPal Mafia is a set of former PayPal executives and employees &#8212; such as Elon Musk, a South African, and Peter Thiel, a German American &#8212; who have gone on to seriously disrupt not one but<a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/paypal-mafia-members-careers-elon-musk-peter-thiel-reid-hoffman-2019-11#there-are-several-more-former-paypal-employees-who-went-on-to-have-careers-both-in-and-out-of-technology-29\"> multiple industries<\/a> across tech. Among the companies they\u2019ve founded are YouTube, LinkedIn, Yelp and Tesla, and they\u2019ve even been named U.S. ambassadors. That\u2019s just one company. Imagine what other diverse and driven teams can do with the influx of cash and inspiration that comes with a big exit. There will be a ripple effect of team members eager to start out on their own who feel empowered by the success of someone who believed in them.<\/p>\n<p>Their ventures will be more likely to \u201cpass it on\u201d when it comes to giving equal opportunities to people regardless of origin and will generate more jobs for people with their mission. Take Thiel, who has to date backed<a href=\"https:\/\/sifted.eu\/articles\/peter-thiel-european-investments\/\"> over 40 companies<\/a> in Europe alone.<\/p>\n<p>As VCs, we can capitalize on this team effect by keeping our eye on any spinoff ventures that arise and supporting them when possible (with experience and contacts, if not with capital). But beyond this, you can also consider encouraging these people to join the investment sphere, maybe even within your firm. Many successful startup founders and executives go on to become investors &#8212; the PayPal Mafia has contributed to some of the most notorious funds out there today. The origin story of these former team members will make them more prone to supporting underrepresented founders they can get behind. In turn, new entrepreneurs will draw more value from their personal experiences.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Reputation effect<\/h2>\n<p>Although Returnly is headquartered in San Francisco, its founder is Spanish and many of its employees were based in Spain.<\/p>\n<p>That means that the impact of Returnly\u2019s exit will be felt on the other side of the Atlantic as well as among co-nationals in the United States. The same is true of other notable sales, like AlienVault, which was founded in Spain and had multiple offices there. AlienVault was<a href=\"https:\/\/elreferente.es\/venture-capital\/las-20-ventas-millonarias-mas-relevantes-de-startups-espanolas\/\"> acquired<\/a> by U.S. telecommunications giant AT&amp;T for $900 million. Or IPOs &#8212; earlier this month, the Spanish-origin payments company Flywire<a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/newsletter\/payments-specialist-flywire-files-for-ipo\"> filed for an IPO<\/a> that could value the company at $3 billion. One startup\u2019s success boosts the reputation of its entire team, and with it other founders and talent with their same country of origin, background, education and drive.<\/p>\n<p>It follows that investors and other stakeholders will be more inclined to back opportunities among founders from the same home country if it says something about the mission, expertise and culture they bring to their startup.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, growing startups will be more interested in hiring the talent of evidently successful teams. That doesn\u2019t just mean hiring more foreign experts in the United States, but seeking to outsource farther afield. We\u2019re already becoming far more comfortable with remote teams, and it\u2019s more capital-efficient for one half of the team to be working while the other half sleeps. But founders will always gravitate more to countries where local talent and innovation is already seen to be thriving. Open up that conversation with your portfolio companies.<\/p>\n<p>VCs have the power to change an industry forever, to connect startup ecosystems across continents and to see startups expand worldwide. But this is about staying relevant as an investor as much as it\u2019s about ensuring this next stage in the startup world is a positive one.<\/p>\n<p>Investors who don\u2019t recognize that the future of startups is global and diverse in nature won\u2019t be in sync with the best opportunities &#8212; and won\u2019t be selected by the best founders. Rather than trying to play catchup, help build that ecosystem.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Investors who don\u2019t recognize that the future of startups is global and diverse

Currently, the average American <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/13\/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion\/\">watches<\/a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>Apps aren\u2019t just a way to pass idle hours \u2014 they\u2019re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/15\/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> combined<\/a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/13\/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion\/\">poured<\/a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies \u2014 a figure that\u2019s up 27% year-over-year.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><em><strong>This Week in Apps will soon be a newsletter!

The project, which puts the decision about Likes in the hands of the company\u2019s global user base, had been in development for years, but was deprioritized due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the response work required on Facebook\u2019s part. When the company tested how people felt about Like counts, it got pushback from both sides &#8212; some wanted to see this information and others felt it was leading to a negative, competitive experience.<\/p>\n<p>The company decided to split the difference and put the decision in its users&#8217; hands. Via new settings, users can choose to disable Like counts on the posts they make and those that appear when they browse the social apps&#8217; feeds.<\/p>\n<p>The decision, however, indicates not one of user empowerment, but rather one representative of a company that&#8217;s so large (and intent on remaining the largest), it declines to have its own point of view on controversial matters for fear of causing a mass exit. You can see this in other areas of the business as well, like how it wanted to downplay its responsibility with regard to the misinformation it recirculated by leaving it to fact-checkers to handle, or how it offloaded hard decisions about takedowns to an advisory board. While it&#8217;s one thing to not want to piss off a large number of users, turning every toggle and setting into a user choice is just another way at shrugging off responsibility while claiming that something has been done.<\/p>\n<h3>Poparazzi hypes and growth hacks to the top<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2157861\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2157861\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2157861\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg 3282w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=150,63 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=300,125 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=768,321 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=680,284 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=1536,642 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=2048,856 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2157861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Poparazzi<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a new app with its own point of view has made it to the top. Recently launched anti-selfie app <a href=\"https:\/\/www.poparazzi.xyz\/\">Poparazzi<\/a> sees itself as a referendum on the Instagram age of performative and self-obsessed social media. The app turns the &#8220;tag your friends in photos&#8221; feature from Instagram into a standalone, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store\/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29\">excellently marketed and growth-hacked app experience<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Your Poparazzi profile can only be added to by your friends, which makes the app feel more authentic as it captures casual, unpolished moments, not those you&#8217;ve rehearsed and filtered to perfection. But the viral app favors giving up some user privacy protections for network effects, which could potentially be harmful. In the end, it also overlooks why people use social media today: self-expression. Posting pictures to other profiles doesn&#8217;t fulfill that desire. That means the app either become an additive experience to be used alongside your existing preferred social app, or one that&#8217;s risking a bet on a future where people are actually less self-involved. We can only hope.<\/p>\n<h3>Apple-Epic trial officially adjourns<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2031365\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2031365\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2031365\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/fortnite-epic-GettyImages-957063528.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/fortnite-epic-GettyImages-957063528.jpg 4000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/fortnite-epic-GettyImages-957063528.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/fortnite-epic-GettyImages-957063528.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/fortnite-epic-GettyImages-957063528.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/fortnite-epic-GettyImages-957063528.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/fortnite-epic-GettyImages-957063528.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/fortnite-epic-GettyImages-957063528.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/fortnite-epic-GettyImages-957063528.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2031365\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Andrew Harrer\/Bloomberg via Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As the Apple-Epic App Store antitrust trial adjourns, the judge seemed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/apple-facing-potential-loss-in-app-store-antitrust-case-as-judge-turns-hostile\">leaning more<\/a> to Epic&#8217;s point of view on specific matters, including the 30% cut Apple takes and its decision to ban companies from telling their customers where they could get a better deal on an in-app purchase. (Tim Cook taking the stand <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/21\/tim-cook-plays-innocent-in-epic-v-apples-culminating-testimony\/\">only to claim ignorance<\/a> of certain key aspects of the App Store business didn&#8217;t help matters, either.)<\/p>\n<p>At its core, the case is about whether or not Apple is a monopoly and could set the tone for later lawsuits and government regulation. Epic believes Apple has a monopoly over distribution to the iPhone, but Apple argued there were plenty of other places for a company like Epic to sell its games &#8212; including those that Epic pays a cut to without complaint, like Microsoft and Sony. Epic, meanwhile, argued that its metaverse is more than just a game, it&#8217;s a social place to hang out.<\/p>\n<p>The judge pointed out both Epic&#8217;s plain-as-day ulterior motives (hint: $$$$), but also the extent to which mobile games &#8212; games that make up the lion&#8217;s share of App Store revenue &#8212; seem to be subsidizing the platform for others. That includes apps where Apple doesn&#8217;t take a cut of IAPs.<\/p>\n<p>Still, <a href=\"https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2021\/05\/apple-epic-trial-antitrust-market-power-fortnite.html\">for the judge to rule for Epic<\/a>, she would have to find that Apple leveraged its market power as a monopoly. And that means Apple has to actually <em>have<\/em> a monopoly in the first place. But does it? There are other places to buy apps (Google&#8217;s Android devices, e.g.) and games, like console platforms. Epic wants the definition of a monopoly here narrowed to the market for apps on Apple devices, and that may not work. Though the trial has adjourned, a decision will still be months out, so don&#8217;t worry about prepping your in-app credit card forms and PayPal buttons yet.<\/p>\n<h1>Weekly News<\/h1>\n<h3>Platforms: Apple<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2159101\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2159101\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2159101\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Apple_WWDC21-details-announcement_052421_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Apple_WWDC21-details-announcement_052421_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg 1960w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Apple_WWDC21-details-announcement_052421_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Apple_WWDC21-details-announcement_052421_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Apple_WWDC21-details-announcement_052421_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Apple_WWDC21-details-announcement_052421_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Apple_WWDC21-details-announcement_052421_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Apple_WWDC21-details-announcement_052421_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2159101\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>Apple released its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2021\/05\/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-kicks-off-june-7\/\">agenda<\/a> for WWDC 2021, which will still be <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/\">virtual<\/a>.

investors and founders forecast hockey-stick growth for Edinburgh&#8217;s startup scene"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Scotland is slowly but surely drawing attention in the UK&#8217;s startup space. In 2020, Scottish startups collectively raised \u00a3345 million, according to Tech Nation, and with nearly 2,500 startups, it has the highest number of budding tech companies outside London. Venture capital fundraises are also consistently on the rise every year.<\/p>\n<p>Scotland&#8217;s capital Edinburgh boasts a beautiful, hilly landscape, a robust education system and good access to grant funding, public and private investment. It&#8217;s also one of the top financial centers in the U.K., making it a great place to begin a business.<\/p>\n<p>So to find out what the startup scene in Edinburgh looks like, we spoke to six founders, executives and investors. The city&#8217;s tech ecosystem appears to have a robust space for machine learning, artificial intelligence, biomedicine, fintech, travel tech, oil, renewables, e-commerce, gaming, health tech, deep tech, space tech and insurtech.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Use discount code <b>SCOTLANDSURVEY<\/b> to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/\">save 25% off an annual or two-year Extra Crunch membership.<\/a><br \/>\nThis offer is only available to readers in the UK Europe and expires on June 30, 2021.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>However, the city&#8217;s tech scene is apparently lackluster when it comes to legal tech, blockchain and consumer-facing technology.<\/p>\n<p>Breakout companies that were founded in Edinburgh include Skyscanner and FanDuel. Notable among the current crop are Desana, Continuum Industries, Parsley Box, Current Health, Boundary, Zumo, Appointedd, Criton, Mallzee, TravelNest, TVSquared, Care Sourcer, Stampede, For-Sight, Vistalworks, Reath, InfraCost, Speech Graphics and Cyan Forensics.<\/p>\n<p>The Edinburgh business-angel community appears to be quite strong, but it seems local founders find it difficult to get London-based investors to take an interest. Scottish investors are said to be &#8220;pretty conservative and risk-adverse&#8221; with some notable exceptions.<\/p>\n<p>We surveyed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/wendylamin\/\">Wendy Lamin<\/a>, managing director, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.holoxica.com\/\">Holoxica<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/aibnoble\/\">Andrew Noble<\/a>, partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parequity.com\">Par Equity<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/danaeyshell\/\">Danae Shell<\/a>, co-founder and CEO, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.valla.uk\">Valla<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/allan-nelson-37082812\/\">Allan Nelson<\/a>, co-founder and CEO, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.for-sight.com\">For-Sight<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/lzografos\/\">Lysimachos Zografos<\/a>, founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parkure.co.uk\/\">Parkure<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/bertie-wilson-42b33455\/?originalSubdomain=uk\">Bertie Wilson<\/a>, co-founder in stealth mode<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Wendy Lamin, managing director, Holoxica<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?<\/strong><br \/>\nIt&#8217;s strong in space, biomedicine, fintech\/insurtech, AI.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What\u2019s their focus?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Scottish business-angel community is said to be the largest in Europe. It&#8217;s difficult to get London-based investors take an interest in Scotland \u2014 investors can tend to look at where companies are based. It is hard for &#8220;underrepresented founders&#8221; to get investments in Scotland and beyond.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh or will they move out? Will others move in?<\/strong><br \/>\nStay. Not always easy to get people to come and live in Scotland. Edinburgh, there are lots of prejudices, despite it being one of the best cities to live in in the whole of the U.K.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?<\/strong><br \/>\nGood to see more focus on impact investing. Par Equity is one of Edinburgh&#8217;s biggest investors, whereas Archangels is one of the biggest angel investors. Poonam Malik is great for diversity and female entrepreneurs, and she is on the board of Scottish Enterprise, and is a social entrepreneur and investor. Garry Bernstein is also an investor \u2014 he leads the Scottish chapter of Tech London Advocates and Global Tech Advocates, and as such is the founder of Tech Scot Advocates.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years?<\/strong><br \/>\nThriving. The government is doing its best for the tech sector. Education in tech is currently an issue, though. Hope Brexit won&#8217;t be too much of an issue.<\/p>\n<h2>Andrew Noble, partner, Par Equity<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?<\/strong><br \/>\nStrong in fintech, health tech, data science, deep tech. Excited by quantum computing, advanced materials, AI in Edinburgh. Weak in blockchain and consumer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?<\/strong><br \/>\nCurrent Health, InfraCost, Speech Graphics and Cyan Forensics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What\u2019s their focus?<\/strong><br \/>\nGood at seed stage up to \u00a31 million, okay for pre-series A (\u00a31 million to \u00a33 million) and non-existent for Series A (\u00a33 million-\u00a310 million). Quality of investors is improving. Par Equity is leading the way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?<\/strong><br \/>\nExperiencing influx of new talent due to COVID-19. Edinburgh is a highly desirable city to live in. Recent new residents include Aaron Ross (Predictable Revenue) and Jules Pursuad (early employee at Airbnb and now VP at Omio).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?<\/strong><br \/>\nPar Equity (investor), Paul Atkinson, Alistair Forbes, Mark Logan, Lesley Eccles, Chris McCann, CodeBase.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years?<\/strong><br \/>\nOne to two new unicorns. Promising number of high-growth tech companies. A much more sophisticated investor scene in the Series A space.<\/p>\n<h2>Danae Shell, co-founder and CEO, Valla<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?<\/strong><br \/>\nEdinburgh is strong in fintech because of our proximity to so many financial services companies and banks. Also, there are some exciting games tech companies because of our history of games companies. We&#8217;re pretty weak in law tech, Valla&#8217;s area.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?<\/strong><br \/>\nVistalworks for consumer tech; Sustainably for fintech; Reath for sustainable tech.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What\u2019s their focus?<\/strong><br \/>\nAs a rule, Scottish investors are pretty conservative and risk-averse. The only real exception is Techstart Ventures, in my experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?<\/strong><br \/>\nI think more people will come to Edinburgh from London because the quality of life and cost of living are both so much better here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?<\/strong><br \/>\nCalum Forsyth and Mark Hogarth at Techstart Ventures; Janine Matheson at CodeBase; Jackie Waring from the Investing Women angel syndicate; Jim Newbury is a very well-respected developer and coach, and my co-founder Kate Ho is also well known. Also Danny Helson who runs the EIE event with the Bayes Centre.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years?<\/strong><br \/>\nWe&#8217;ve had a few exits in the past few years (Skyscanner, FreeAgent), which means that talent is spreading out across the ecosystem here and we&#8217;re getting some fantastic new startups kicking off. In five years, that first crop should be coming into the Series A stage so we could see a lot of super exciting businesses!<\/p>\n<h2>Allan Nelson, co-founder and CEO, For-Sight<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?<\/strong><br \/>\nStrong in fintech, travel tech, health, oil, renewables, e-commerce, gaming (both video game and gambling tech). Excited by all bar oil (great driver of revenue, but not the future).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?<\/strong><br \/>\nBoundary, Parsley Box, Appointedd, Criton, Mallzee, TravelNest, TVSquared, Care Sourcer, Stampede, For-Sight.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What\u2019s their focus?<\/strong><br \/>\nBig fintech scene here. Travel tech is growing too, with Skyscanner&#8217;s influence strong.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?<\/strong><br \/>\nMost will stay, as it&#8217;s a very attractive city to live and work in. It&#8217;s a globally recognized and unique city. Very international flavor as evidenced by the makeup of our team.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?<\/strong><br \/>\nEx-Skyscanner people including Gareth Williams, Mark Logan, etc. Ian Ritchie, Alistair Forbes, the FanDuel&#8217;s founders and the CodeBase founders.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years?<\/strong><br \/>\nA lot bigger, as tech is a key growth target of the Scottish government and is underpinned\/influenced\/inspired by Skyscanner and FanDuel.<\/p>\n<h2>Lysimachos Zografos, founder, Parkure<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?<\/strong><br \/>\nStrong in machine learning\/AI\/digital. Weak in deep tech discovery, especially in biotech\/therapeutics. Excited by the rise in adoption of AI in drug discovery \u2014 all these ideas that were sci-fi 20 years ago are now adopted in \u00a3B deals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?<\/strong><br \/>\nPheno Therapeutics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What\u2019s their focus?<\/strong><br \/>\nConservative angels and a few tech seed VCs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?<\/strong><br \/>\nMove in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?<\/strong><br \/>\nInvestors: Archangels, Techstart Ventures and Epidarex.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years?<\/strong><br \/>\nGrowing.<\/p>\n<h2>Bertie Wilson, co-founder, \u201cStealth mode\u201d<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?<\/strong><br \/>\nI don&#8217;t think there are any sectors that stand out \u2014 it&#8217;s fairly evenly split. A good strength of the city is the talent that comes from the universities. There are some really good engineers that come from Edinburgh, Heriot Watt and Edinburgh Napier. The main weakness is that the ecosystem doesn&#8217;t favor the most ambitious founders. Most investors in the region are angels and aren&#8217;t interested in finding outliers that could grow 1000x and are more interested in backing companies that are less risky but might 5x their money. If you want to find investors that will back risky (but very ambitious) plans, it&#8217;s easier to find that elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?<\/strong><br \/>\nDesana, Continuum Industries, Parsley Box, Current Health, Boundary, Zumo.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What\u2019s their focus?<\/strong><br \/>\nI would say it&#8217;s getting better, but there are still a lot of issues with the ecosystem. It is being helped in Scotland by the likes of Techstart investing at the earliest stages with high conviction and term sheets that are more similar to London VCs. Outside of this, though, it&#8217;s easy for founders to end up with a messy cap table due to the number of angels and lack of VCs looking for VC-type returns \u2014 the messiness of these cap tables can then make it hard to raise venture funding down the line. This is fine for a lot of companies that aren&#8217;t aiming for a venture-scale return (which admittedly is a lot), but it can hurt those that are.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?<\/strong><br \/>\nI imagine and hope others will move in. It is a great place to live with a very high quality of life, and this should be a natural attraction for people who want a good standard of living but want to remain in a city.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?<\/strong><br \/>\nSEP (investor), Techstart Ventures (investor), Gareth Williams (founder\/investor), MBM Commercial (lawyers), Pentech, Bill Dobbie (investor), Jamie Coleman.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years?<\/strong><br \/>\nOptimistically, I hope that there will be a good number of companies that are at the Series B\/Series C stage, which will invite a lot more interest from investors outside of Edinburgh (London, Berlin, Paris, New York, San Francisco, etc.) to start investing more actively in the city at the earliest stages as well as these stages.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scotland&#8217;s capital Edinburgh

at a conference on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Alibaba Cloud is one of the fastest-growing businesses for the Chinese e-commerce giant and the world&#8217;s fourth-largest public cloud service in the second half of 2020, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.idc.com\/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47685521\">according to market research firm IDC<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The global chip market has mostly been dominated by Intel&#8217;s x86 in personal computing and Arm for mobile devices. But RISC-V, an open-source chip architecture competitive with Arm&#8217;s technologies, is gaining popularity around the world, especially with Chinese developers. Started by academics at the University of California, Berkeley, RISC-V is open to all to use without licensing or patent fees and is generally not subject to America&#8217;s export controls.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The Trump Administration&#8217;s bans <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/18\/huawei-uncertainties-new-us-chip-rules-tsmc\/\">on Huawei<\/a> and its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/14\/trump-adds-another-year-to-huawei-zte-ban\/\">rival ZTE<\/a> over national security concerns have effectively severed ties between the Chinese telecom titans and American tech companies, including major semiconductor suppliers.<\/p>\n<p>Arm was forced to decide its relationships with Huawei and said it<a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/tech\/tech-trends\/article\/3127782\/british-chip-design-firm-arm-takes-aim-intel-biggest-tech-overhaul\"> could continue licensing to the Chinese firm<\/a> as it&#8217;s of U.K. origin. But Huawei still struggles to find fabs that are both capable and allowed to actually manufacture the chips designed using the architecture.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. sanctions led to a burst in activity around RISC-V in China&#8217;s tech industry as developers prepare for future tech restrictions by the U.S., with Alibaba at the forefront of the movement. Alibaba Cloud, Huawei and ZTE are among the 13 premier members of <a href=\"https:\/\/riscv.org\/members\/\">RISC-V International<\/a>, which means they get a seat on its Board of Directors and Technical Steering Community.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, the e-commerce company&#8217;s semiconductor division T-Head launched its first core processor Xuantie 910, which is based on RISC-V and used for cloud edge and IoT applications. Having its operating system work with multiple chip systems instead of one mainstream architecture could prepare Alibaba Cloud well for a future of chip independence in China.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The IT ecosystem was traditionally defined by chips, but cloud computing fundamentally changed that,&#8221; Zhang Jianfeng, president of Alibaba Cloud&#8217;s Intelligence group, said at the event. &#8220;A cloud operating system can standardize the computing power of server chips, special-purpose chips and other hardware, so whether the chip is based on x86, Arm, RISC-V or a hardware accelerator, the cloud computing offerings for customers are standardized and of high-quality.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, some argue that Chinese companies moving towards alternatives like RISC-V means more polarization of technology and standards, which is not ideal for global collaboration unless RISC-V becomes widely adopted in the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"sCg9RXxfvT\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/29\/sifives-new-pc-is-bringing-open-source-computing-closer-to-reality\/\">SiFive\u2019s new PC is bringing open-source computing closer to reality<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;SiFive\u2019s new PC is bringing open-source computing closer to reality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/29\/sifives-new-pc-is-bringing-open-source-computing-closer-to-reality\/embed\/#?secret=sCg9RXxfvT\" data-secret=\"sCg9RXxfvT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alibaba&#8217;s cloud computing unit is making its Apsara operating system compatible with processors based on Arm, x86, RISC-V, among other architectures, the company\u00a0announced at a conference on Friday.

startups across the world are re-inventing how we work. But founders aren\u2019t flocking to build just another SaaS tool or Airtable copycat \u2014 they&#8217;re trying to disrupt the only thing possibly more annoying than e-mail: the work meeting.<\/p>\n<p>On an episode of this week&#8217;s podcast, Equity hosts Alex Wilhelm, Danny Crichton and Natasha Mascarenhas discussed a flurry of funding rounds related to the future of work.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.simplecast.com\/1f003db3-c3b6-4a9b-9bd9-7d4082236cd9?dark=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200px\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Rewatch, which makes meetings asynchronous, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/zoom-fatigue-no-more-rewatch-raises-20m-to-index-transcribe-and-store-enterprise-video-content\/\">raised $20 million from Andreessen Horowitz<\/a>, AnyClip <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/25\/anyclip-snaps-up-47m-for-its-video-search-and-analytics-technology\/\">got $47 million in a round led by JVP<\/a> for video search and analytics technology, Interactio, a remote interpretation platform, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/25\/interactio-a-remote-interpretation-platform-grabs-30m-after-seeing-12x-growth-during-covid-19\/\">landed $30 million from Eight Roads Ventures and Silicon Valley-based Storm Ventures<\/a>, and Spot Meetings got <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/spot-meetings-seed\/\">Kleiner Perkins on board in a $5 million seed.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>We connected the dots between these funding rounds to sketch out three perspectives on the future of workplace meetings. Part of our reasoning was the uptick of investment as mentioned above, and the other is that our calendars are full of them. We all agree that the traditional meeting is broken, so below you\u2019ll find each of our arguments on where they go next and what we\u2019d like to see.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alex Wilhelm: Faster information throughput, please<\/li>\n<li>Natasha Mascarenhas:\u00a0Meetings should be ongoing, not in calendar invites<\/li>\n<li>Danny Crichton: Redesign meetings for flow<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Alex Wilhelm: Faster information throughput, please<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve worked for companies that were in love with meetings, and for companies where meetings were more infrequent. I prefer the latter by a wide margin. I\u2019ve also worked in offices full-time, half-time and fully remote. I immensely prefer the final option.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Work meetings are often a waste of time. Mostly you don\u2019t need to align, most folks taking part are superfluous and as accidental team-building exercises they are incredibly expensive in terms of human-hours.<\/p>\n<p>I am not into wasting time. The more remote I\u2019ve been and the less time I\u2019ve spent in less-formal meetings &#8212; the usual chit-chat that pollutes productive work time, making the days longer and less useful &#8212; the more I\u2019ve managed to get done.<\/p>\n<p>But I\u2019ve been the lucky one, frankly. Most folks were still trapped in offices up until the pandemic shook up the world of work, finally giving more companies a shot at a whole-cloth rebuild of how they toil.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that CEOs are taking note. Chatting with Sprout Social CEO Justyn Howard this week, he explained how we have a unique, new chance to not live near where we work in 2021, but to instead bring work to where we live. He\u2019s also an introvert, which meant that as a pair we\u2019ve found a number of positives in some of the changes to how tech and media companies operate. Perhaps we\u2019re a little biased.<\/p>\n<p>A number of startups are rushing to fill the gap between the new expectations that Howard noted and our old digital and IRL realities.<\/p>\n<p>Tandem.chat might be one such company. The former <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/20\/tandem\/\">Y Combinator launch-day darling<\/a> has spent its post-halo period building. Its CEO sent me a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.tandem.chat\/the-virtual-office-is-here-to-stay\/\">manifesto of sorts<\/a> the other day, discussing how his company approaches the future of work meetings. Tandem is building for a world where communication needs to be both real-time and internal; it leaves asynchronous internal communication to Slack, real-time external communications to Zoom and asynchronous external chats to email.

the business realm they have yielded a change in corporate behavior and consumer expectation &#8212; changes that showed up in a bushel of earnings reports this week.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch may tend to have a private-company focus, but we do keep tabs on public companies in the tech world as they often provide hints, notes and other pointers on how startups may be faring. In this case, however, we\u2019re working in reverse; startups have told us for several quarters now that their markets are picking up momentum as customers shake up their buying behavior with a distinct advantage for companies helping customers move into the digital realm. And public company results are now confirming the startups\u2019 perspective.<\/p>\n<p>The accelerating digital transformation is real, and we have the data to support the point.<\/p>\n<p>What follows is a digest of notes concerning the recent earnings results from Box, Sprout Social, Yext, Snowflake and Salesforce. We\u2019ll approach each in micro to save time, but as always there\u2019s more digging to be done if you have time.

Today its shares are up 18%. And a call with the company\u2019s CEO Howard Lerman underscored our general thesis regarding the digital transformation\u2019s acceleration.<\/p>\n<p>In brief, Yext\u2019s evolution from a company that plugged corporate information into external search engines to building and selling search tech itself has been resonating in the market. Why? Lerman explained that consumers more and more expect digital service in response to their questions &#8212; &#8220;who wants to call a 1-800 number,&#8221; he asked rhetorically &#8212; which is forcing companies to rethink the way they handle customer inquiries.<\/p>\n<p>In turn, those companies are looking to companies like Yext that offer technology to better answer customer queries in a digital format. It\u2019s customer-friendly, and could save companies money as call centers are expensive. A change in behavior accelerated by the pandemic is forcing companies to adapt, driving their purchase of more digital technologies like this.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s proof that a transformation doesn&#8217;t have to be dramatic to have pretty strong impacts on how corporations buy and sell online.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What follows is a digest of notes concerning the recent earnings results from Box, Sprout Social, Yext, Snowflake and Salesforce.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":521068,"featured_media":2158949,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"d3e40516-6bc0-3af2-a52a-10d65bfbaf4d"},"categories":[24405894,42919851,449557044,576605952],"tags":[53395,576846311,15328,97017,924097,36036697,25753030],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796354],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1271697775.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3vvF8Ek","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.37,"featured":true,"subtitle":"And impacting the latest SaaS earnings reports","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1461024,983141],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2158933"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2158933"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2158933\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2159065,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2158933\/revisions\/2159065"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/alex-wilhelm"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/ronjourn"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2158933&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/521068"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2158949"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2158933"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2158933"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2158933"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2158933"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2158933"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2158933"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2158933"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1461024,"name":"Alex Wilhelm","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/alex-wilhelm\/","description":"Alex Wilhelm is the editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchbase.news\">Crunchbase News<\/a> and co-host of <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/equity\/id1215439780?mt=2\">Equity<\/a>, TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast.","slug":"alex-wilhelm","links":{"facebook":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alex.wilhelm","twitter":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alexwilhelm\/","homepage":"","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/alex-wilhelm"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"<p>Alex Wilhelm is Senior Editor at TechCrunch.

Justos, the new Brazilian insurtech that just got backing from the CEOs of 7 unicorns"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here in the U.S. the concept of using a driver\u2019s data to decide the cost of auto insurance premiums is not a new one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in markets like Brazil, the idea is still considered relatively novel. A new startup called Justos claims it will be the first Brazilian insurer to use drivers\u2019 data to reward those who drive safely by offering \u201cfairer\u201d prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And now Justos has raised about $2.8 million in a seed round led by Kaszek, one of the largest and most active VC firms in Latin America. Big Bets also participated in the round, along with the CEOs of seven unicorns, including Assaf Wand, CEO and co-founder of Hippo Insurance; David V\u00e9lez, founder and CEO of Nubank; Carlos Garcia, founder and CEO of Kavak; Sergio Furio, founder and CEO of Creditas; Patrick Sigrist, founder of iFood and Fritz Lanman, CEO of ClassPass. (There&#8217;s a seventh CEO who wishes to remain anonymous). Senior executives from Robinhood, Stripe, Wise, Carta and Capital One also put money in the round.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serial entrepreneurs Dhaval Chadha, Jorge Soto Moreno and Antonio<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Molins co-founded Justos, having most recently worked at various Silicon Valley-based companies including ClassPass, Netflix and Airbnb.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;While we have been friends for a<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">while, it was a coincidence that all three of us were thinking about building something new<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in Latin America,&#8221; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chadha said. \u201cWe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> spent two months studying<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">possible paths, talking to people and investors in the United States, Brazil and Mexico, until<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we came up with the idea of creating an insurance company that can modernize the sector,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">starting with auto insurance.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the trio decided that the auto insurance market would be an ideal sector considering that in Brazil, an estimated more than 70% of cars are not insured.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process to get insurance in the country, by any accounts, is a slow one. It takes up to 72 hours to receive initial coverage and two weeks to receive the final insurance policy.

But many questions remain about the origins of the virus and the U.S. has yet to rule out the possibility that the virus emerged from a Chinese lab \u2014 a scenario that would be a bombshell for international relations.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the COVID policy change, Facebook announced that it would finally implement <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2021\/05\/taking-action-against-people-who-repeatedly-share-misinformation\/amp\/?__twitter_impression=true\">harsher punishments<\/a> against individuals who repeatedly peddle misinformation.

is the new AI research outfit from OpenAI&#8217;s Dario Amodei, and it has $124M to burn"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">As AI has grown from a menagerie of research projects to include a handful of titanic, industry-powering models like GPT-3, there is a need for the sector to evolve \u2014 or so thinks Dario Amodei, former VP of research at OpenAI, who struck out on his own to create a new company a few months ago. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropic.com\/\">Anthropic<\/a>, as it&#8217;s called, was founded with his sister Daniela and its goal is to create &#8220;large-scale AI systems that are steerable, interpretable, and robust.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The challenge the siblings Amodei are tackling is simply that these AI models, while incredibly powerful, are not well understood. GPT-3, which they worked on, is an astonishingly versatile language system that can produce extremely convincing text in practically any style, and on any topic.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hDo1z2rXH9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/17\/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable\/\">Okay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Okay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/17\/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable\/embed\/#?secret=hDo1z2rXH9\" data-secret=\"hDo1z2rXH9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>But say you had it generate rhyming couplets with Shakespeare and Pope as examples. How does it do it? What is it &#8220;thinking&#8221;? Which knob would you tweak, which dial would you turn, to make it more melancholy, less romantic, or limit its diction and lexicon in specific ways? Certainly there are parameters to change here and there, but really no one knows exactly how this extremely convincing language sausage is being made.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one thing to not know when an AI model is generating poetry, quite another when the model is watching a department store for suspicious behavior, or fetching legal precedents for a judge about to pass down a sentence. Today the general rule is: the more powerful the system, the harder it is to explain its actions. That&#8217;s not exactly a good trend.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Large, general systems of today can have significant benefits, but can also be unpredictable, unreliable, and opaque: our goal is to make progress on these issues,&#8221; reads the company&#8217;s self-description. &#8220;For now, we\u2019re primarily focused on research towards these goals; down the road, we foresee many opportunities for our work to create value commercially and for public benefit.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Excited to announce what we\u2019ve been working on this year &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnthropicAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AnthropicAI<\/a>, an AI safety and research company. If you\u2019d like to help us combine safety research with scaling ML models while thinking about societal impacts, check out our careers page <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/TVHA0t7VLc\">https:\/\/t.co\/TVHA0t7VLc<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Daniela Amodei (@DanielaAmodei) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DanielaAmodei\/status\/1398306463945158656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>The goal seems to be to integrate safety principles into the existing priority system of AI development that generally favors efficiency and power. Like any other industry, it&#8217;s easier and more effective to incorporate something from the beginning than to bolt it on at the end. Attempting to make some of the biggest models out there able to be picked apart and understood may be more work than building them in the first place. Anthropic seems to be starting fresh.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Anthropic\u2019s goal is to make the fundamental research advances that will let us build more capable, general, and reliable AI systems, then deploy these systems in a way that benefits people,&#8221; said Dario Amodei, CEO of the new venture, in a short post announcing the company and its $124 million in funding.<\/p>\n<p>That funding, by the way, is as star-studded as you might expect. It was led by Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and included James McClave, Dustin Moskovitz, Eric Schmidt and the Center for Emerging Risk Research, among others.<\/p>\n<p>The company is a public benefit corporation, and the plan for now, as the limited information on the site suggests, is to remain heads-down on researching these fundamental questions of how to make large models more tractable and interpretable. We can expect more information later this year, perhaps, as the mission and team coalesces and initial results pan out.<\/p>\n<p>The name, incidentally, is adjacent to anthropocentric, and concerns relevancy to human experience or existence. Perhaps it derives from the &#8220;Anthropic principle,&#8221; the notion that intelligent life is possible in the universe because&#8230; well, we&#8217;re here. If intelligence is inevitable under the right conditions, the company just has to create those conditions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YwUPQJOa6R\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/google-ai-concocts-breakie-and-cakie-hybrid-baked-goods\/\">Google AI concocts &#8216;breakie&#8217;

Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot system technically does not rise to the level of fully autonomous, even though it is branded as such. It is considered \u2014 even internally, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/07\/tesla-refutes-elon-musks-timeline-on-full-self-driving\/\">according to exchanges between Tesla and California regulators<\/a> \u2014 an advanced driver assistance system that can automate certain functions.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>LVCC\u2019s parent body, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitor\u2019s Authority, created a contract aimed at incentivizing Musk and ensuring promises are met. The contract is for a fixed price, and TBC has to hit specific milestones to receive all of its payments. The contract provides payments at different points in the process, such as completing the bare tunnels, the entire working system, finishing a <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">test period and safety report and then demonstrating it can carry passengers. The final three milestones relate to how many passengers it can carry. If the Loop can demonstrate moving 2,200 passengers an hour, TBC will get $4.4 million, then the same payment again for hitting 3,300, and the same again for 4,400 passengers an hour. Together, these capacity payments represent 30% of the fixed-price contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Instead of moving more than 4,000 passengers an hour, the constrained system could limit the capacity to less than 1,000, exposing TBC to hefty penalties for missing contractual targets. TBC doesn&#8217;t generate revenue from charging passengers (the rides are free).<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Update<\/strong><\/em>: Shortly after publication, Steve Hill, president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SHillforVegas\/status\/1398497136623247361?s=20\">tweeted that a Loop<\/a> test this week, with a few hundred participants, had demonstrated its planned 4,400 passenger per hour capacity. This could release the additional construction funds mentioned below. TBC still has to achieve this figure during actual conferences in the months ahead to avoid penalties. TechCrunch shared its reporting with the LVCVA, Clark Country and TBC numerous times, over a period of weeks, prior to publication. Only LVCVA provided a substantive reply, and none addressed the question of capacity, nor the outstanding questions about children or passengers with mobility issues.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, during a large trade show like CES, the LVCC will pay TBC $30,000 for every day it operates and manages the system, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/20702362-2021-1-management-agreement-feb-4-final\">management agreement<\/a> newly obtained by TechCrunch. However, the original contract signed by TBC in 2019 specifies a $300,000 penalty for each large convention where TBC cannot move around 4,000 people per hour.<\/p>\n<p>This means that over the course of a three- or four-day event, TBC stands to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars, above and beyond the cost of running the system. In a typical pre-pandemic year, LVCC would host around a dozen such large shows. It&#8217;s unclear if TBC is planning on another means of making money such as revenue from advertising in its cars.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Nf5h7wegCw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/16\/elon-musk-boring-company-the-brick-store\/\">The Boring Company goes brick-and-mortar with The Brick Store<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The Boring Company goes brick-and-mortar with The Brick Store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/16\/elon-musk-boring-company-the-brick-store\/embed\/#?secret=Nf5h7wegCw\" data-secret=\"Nf5h7wegCw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>This capacity issue is already costing TBC money. The contract states that if TBC misses its performance target by such a margin, Musk\u2019s company will not receive more than $13 million of its construction budget. The convention center authority confirmed to TechCrunch that, per its contract, it is withholding that construction fee until TBC can demonstrate moving thousands of people an hour.<\/p>\n<p>Smaller shows, numbering about 20 a year, carry no capacity penalties but earn TBC a much smaller fee of just $11,500 a day, according to the agreement.

These reportedly include a 40 mph overall speed limit, dropping to 10 mph within each of the Loop&#8217;s three stations, and a restriction to just 11 vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>Deputy Fire Chief Warren Whitney of the Clark County Fire Department said that TBC had told him the company wasn&#8217;t allowed to use Tesla&#8217;s collision warning systems within the Loop. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/20792266-2021-5-11-ats-certificate\">transportation system certificate<\/a> issued by Clark County this week specified that the Loop must use &#8220;non-autonomous&#8221; &#8220;manually driven&#8221; vehicles. It was issued for the planned 62 vehicles. Neither Clark County officials nor TBC provided responses to detailed questions on the operational restrictions, nor indicated when or if they could be lifted.<\/p>\n<p>Toyota has previously warned that its radar-based collision warning system may not function correctly within tunnels.<\/p>\n<p>It is not clear whether the Teslas are capable of safe and &#8220;fully autonomous operation&#8221; without their collision-warning radars, although Musk has suggested &#8212; and now executed on a plan &#8212; to remove radar sensors from its vehicles and only use cameras. Tesla started delivering Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in May that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/25\/tesla-is-no-longer-using-radar-sensors-in-model-3-and-model-y-vehicles-built-in-north-america\/\">do not have radar sensors<\/a>. The lack of radar sensors has prompted the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration to say that Model 3 and Model Y vehicles built on or after April 27, 2021 will no longer receive the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/27\/tesla-has-activated-its-in-car-camera-to-monitor-drivers-using-autopilot\/\">agency&#8217;s check mark<\/a> for automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, lane departure warning and dynamic brake support. The decision also prompted Consumer Reports to no longer list the Model 3 as a Top Pick, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said it plans to remove the Model 3&#8217;s Top Safety Pick+ designation.<\/p>\n<p>The Fire Department also had concerns about dealing with emergencies within the tunnels, including battery fires that can potentially last many hours. &#8220;There have been cases where electric cars have caught fire without an accident,&#8221; Whitney told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our plan right now would be just to get the people out, then pull back and let the fire continue to burn.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Whitney noted the system has many cameras and smoke alarms, as well as a &#8220;robust&#8221; ventilation system that can move 400,000 cubic feet of air per minute in either direction down the tunnels. This should allow passengers and drivers to escape on foot around the cars. For less serious incidents, TBC has a tow vehicle (also a Tesla) to extract broken-down cars.<\/p>\n<p>Neither TBC nor Clark County replied to TechCrunch queries about whether the Loop would be allowed to transport wheelchair users, children or infants usually requiring car seats, people with other mobility issues or pets and support animals.<\/p>\n<p>Firefighters have already conducted multiple drills in the underground system, including simulated accidents far from a station, with two or three other vehicles in the way. &#8220;Eleven cars is definitely doable,&#8221; says Whitney. &#8220;But when you start increasing numbers of cars, it may be a problem. [TBC] is a for-profit company and is going want to maximize the efficiency, so there may be further discussions as they try to increase the capacity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Expansion plans<\/h2>\n<p>Not only does TBC want to use more vehicles in the existing Loop, it is already planning to expand the system. At the end of March, TBC told Clark County that it had broken ground on an extension from one LVCC station to the new Resorts World hotel, and it is has permission for a similar spur to the Encore nearby.<\/p>\n<p>More significantly, TBC also wants to build a transit system covering much of the Strip and downtown Las Vegas with more than 40 stations connecting dozens of hotels, attractions and, ultimately, the airport. That system would be financed by TBC and supported by ticket sales.<\/p>\n<p>The viability of those expansions could depend on how soon TBC can meet the technological and operational promises it made for its relatively simple LVCC Loop, and demonstrate whether taxis in tunnels can generate as much revenue as they do column inches.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"rRoZvBv8gr\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/16\/elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-might-only-carry-a-fraction-of-the-passengers-it-promised\/\">Elon Musk&#8217;s Las Vegas Loop might only carry a fraction of the passengers it promised<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Elon Musk&#8217;s Las Vegas Loop might only carry a fraction of the passengers it promised&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/16\/elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-might-only-carry-a-fraction-of-the-passengers-it-promised\/embed\/#?secret=rRoZvBv8gr\" data-secret=\"rRoZvBv8gr\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Please see update below&#8230; Restrictions put in place by Nevada regulators are making it difficult for The Boring Company (TBC) to meet contractual targets for its LVCC Loop, Elon Musk&#8217;s first underground transportation system.

The Las Vegas Convention Center Loop is an underground transportation system that is the first commercial project by Elon Musk\u2019s The Boring Company. The USD 52.5 million loop, which includes two one-way vehicle tunnels 40 feet beneath the ground and three passenger stations, will take convention attendees across the 200-acre convention campus for free in all-electric Tesla vehicles in under two minutes. To walk that distance can take upward of 25 minutes. The system is designed to carry 4,400 people per hour using a fleet of 62 vehicles at maximum capacity. It is scheduled to be fully operational in June when the facility plans to host its first large-scale convention since the COVID-19 shutdown. There are plans to expand the system throughout the resort corridor in the future.

agencies earlier this year, EU lawmakers <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/mex_21_2744\">said today<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The Commission has launched what it described as &#8220;a formal dialogue&#8221; with the video sharing platform over its commercial practices and policy.<\/p>\n<p>Areas of specific concern include hidden marketing, aggressive advertising techniques targeted at children and certain contractual terms in TikTok&#8217;s policies that could be considered misleading and confusing for consumers, per the Commission.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Commenting in a statement, justice commissioner Didier Reynders added: \u201cThe current pandemic has further accelerated digitalisation. This has brought new opportunities but it has also created new risks, in particular for vulnerable consumers. In the European Union, it is prohibited to target children and minors with disguised advertising such as banners in videos. The dialogue we are launching today should support TikTok in complying with EU rules to protect consumers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The background to this is that back in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/16\/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe\/\">February<\/a> the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) sent the Commission a report calling out a number of TikTok&#8217;s policies and practices &#8212; including what it said were unfair terms and copyright practices. It also flagged the risk of children being exposed to inappropriate content on the platform, and accused TikTok of misleading data processing and privacy practices.<\/p>\n<p>Complaints were filed around the same time by consumer organisations in 15 EU countries &#8212; urging those national authorities to investigate the social media giant\u2019s conduct.<\/p>\n<p>The multi-pronged EU action means TikTok has not just the Commission looking at the detail of its small print but is facing questions from a network of national consumer protection authorities &#8212; which is being co-led by the Swedish Consumer Agency and the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (which handles privacy issues related to the platform).<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the BEUC queried why the Commission hasn&#8217;t yet launched a formal enforcement procedure.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">\u201c<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">We hope that the authorities will stick to their guns in this &#8216;dialogue&#8217; which we understand is not yet a formal launch of an enforcement procedure.

In addition, we have taken a number of steps to protect our younger users, including making all under-16 accounts private-by-default, and disabling their access to direct messaging. Further, users under 18 cannot buy, send or receive virtual gifts, and we have strict policies prohibiting advertising directly appealing to those under the age of digital consent.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The company told us it uses age verification for personalized ads &#8212; saying users must have verified that they are 13+ to receive these ads; as well as being over the age of digital consent in their respective EU country; and also having consented to receive targeted ads.<\/p>\n<p>However, TikTok&#8217;s age verification technology has been criticized as weak before now &#8212; and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/03\/tiktok-will-recheck-the-age-of-every-user-in-italy-after-dpa-order\/\">recent emergency child-safety-focused enforcement action<\/a> by the Italian national data protection agency has led to TikTok having to pledge to strengthen its age verification processes in the country.<\/p>\n<p>The Italian enforcement action also resulted in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/12\/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users\/\">TikTok removing more than 500,000 accounts<\/a> suspected of belonging to users aged younger than 13 earlier this month &#8212; raising further questions about whether it can really claim that under-13s aren&#8217;t routinely exposed to targeted ads on its platform.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"9l5vl0fpD2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/12\/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users\/\">TikTok removes 500k+ accounts in Italy after DPA order to block underage users<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;TikTok removes 500k+ accounts in Italy after DPA order to block underage users&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/12\/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users\/embed\/#?secret=9l5vl0fpD2\" data-secret=\"9l5vl0fpD2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In further background remarks it sent us, TikTok claimed it has clear labelling of sponsored content.
